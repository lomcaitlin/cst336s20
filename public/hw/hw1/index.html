            <p>Front-end web development is the practice of creating a graphical interface for data through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so that users can view and interact with it.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Tools Used</h2>
            <p>There are are multiple different tools and platforms that can be used to develop the front end of a website.</p>

            <h3>Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML)</h3>
            <p>HTML is the backbone for all webpages. It provides the overall framework for how the website will look.</p>

            <h3>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h3>
            <p>CSS is what makes the website look visually appealing. It maintains style sheets that sit on top of other style rules.</p>

            <h3>JavaScript</h3>
            <p>JavaScript is an event-based programming language that transforms a static HTML page into a dynamic interface. It manipulates a web page to respond to events such as user input.</p>
